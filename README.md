### Future stuff that's nice to have

 * Smoother vertical leg movement (perhaps a simple sine instead of current bang-bang)
 * Jumping
 * Obstacles for jumping
 * Some text/ui on screen
 * Modern OpenGL
 * Full screen?
 * More user control
 * More dynamic camera
 * sound effects? :)
 * Finish line vs flappy bird :S
 * Auto-create more terrain on demand
